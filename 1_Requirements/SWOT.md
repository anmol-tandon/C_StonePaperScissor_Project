## SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strengths
My game will be available for free. As a result it will have an advantage compared to another game which will be sold for money and everyone will have the chance to try the game, because it doesn’t cost.
The cost of production will be very low considering that Blender and Unity are available for free.  Also, I will use social media to promote my game, something that is free.

## Weaknesses
Available only for PC compared to other games which are published for consoles such as smartphones.  As a result only people who play games at PC would be able to play the game.
Limited budget. This will mean that my game will have less promotion opportunities compared to a video game with strong budget.  

## Opportunities
In case my game will be successful, I can add advertisements within it and start earning some money.  The majority of the profitable games start like that and depending on the resonance they have got, they start making profit.

## Threats
There are many similar game ideas with mine on the web. As a result I can be accused for copyright. As a result I have to be very careful and make sure that I won’t use assets and ideas that any other games have. 

A player will choose one from Stone, Paper or Scissor and similar computer will choose one and accordingly based on the dominating element winner will be choosen.
