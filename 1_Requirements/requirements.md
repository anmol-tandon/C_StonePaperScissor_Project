## Introduction
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game with many names and variations. It is played around the world and is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions. In some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no intrinsic advantage to the stronger, older, or more experienced opponent.

# **Research**
1. Any player may initiate an encounter with another player, who may or may not choose
to accept. (The two players are known as the challenger and the defender respectively.)
No player may be in more than one encounter at the same time.
2. An encounter consists of a number of rounds. In each round, each player commits to
their move (either Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and reveals the commitment to the other
player. The winner of each round is found according to standard Rock-Paper-Scissors
rules (Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock).

## History
The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu [zh] by the Chinese Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi [zh], who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).In the book, the game was called shoushiling. Li Rihua's book Note of Liuyanzhai also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (t. 手勢令; s. 手势令), huozhitou (t. 豁指頭; s. 豁指头), or huaquan (划拳).
Mushi-ken, the earliest Japanese sansukumi-ken game (1809). From left to right: slug (namekuji), frog (kawazu) and snake (hebi).
Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to sansukumi-ken, meaning ken (fist) games where "the three who are afraid of one another" (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A).This type of game originated in China before being imported to Japan and subsequently also becoming popular among the Japanese.


## Strategies
It is impossible to gain an advantage over a truly random opponent. However, by exploiting the psychological weaknesses of inherently non-random opponents, it is possible to gain a significant advantage.Indeed, human players tend to be non-random.As a result, there have been programming competitions for algorithms that play rock paper scissors.During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement. Some tournament players employ tactics to confuse or trick the other player into making an illegal move, resulting in a loss. One such tactic is to shout the name of one move before throwing another, in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent.
The "rock" move, in particular, is notable in that it is typically represented by a closed fist—often identical to the fist made by players during the initial countdown. If a player is attempting to beat their opponent based on quickly reading their hand gesture as the players are making their moves, it is possible to determine if the opponent is about to throw "rock" based on their lack of hand movement, as both "scissors" and "paper" require the player to reposition their hand. This can likewise be used to deceive an anticipating opponent by keeping one's fist closed until the last possible moment, leading them to believe that you are about to throw "rock".

## SWOT ANALYSIS

## Strengths
My game will be available for free. As a result it will have an advantage compared to another game which will be sold for money and everyone will have the chance to try the game, because it doesn’t cost.
The cost of production will be very low considering that Blender and Unity are available for free.  Also, I will use social media to promote my game, something that is free.

## Weaknesses
Available only for PC compared to other games which are published for consoles such as smartphones.  As a result only people who play games at PC would be able to play the game.
Limited budget. This will mean that my game will have less promotion opportunities compared to a video game with strong budget.  

## Opportunities
In case my game will be successful, I can add advertisements within it and start earning some money.  The majority of the profitable games start like that and depending on the resonance they have got, they start making profit.

## Threats
There are many similar game ideas with mine on the web. As a result I can be accused for copyright. As a result I have to be very careful and make sure that I won’t use assets and ideas that any other games have. 

A player will choose one from Stone, Paper or Scissor and similar computer will choose one and accordingly based on the dominating element winner will be choosen.
