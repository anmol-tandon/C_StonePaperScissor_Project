## Introduction
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game with many names and variations. It is played around the world and is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions. In some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no intrinsic advantage to the stronger, older, or more experienced opponent.

# **Research**
1. Any player may initiate an encounter with another player, who may or may not choose
to accept. (The two players are known as the challenger and the defender respectively.)
No player may be in more than one encounter at the same time.
2. An encounter consists of a number of rounds. In each round, each player commits to
their move (either Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and reveals the commitment to the other
player. The winner of each round is found according to standard Rock-Paper-Scissors
rules (Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock).

## History
The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu [zh] by the Chinese Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi [zh], who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE).In the book, the game was called shoushiling. Li Rihua's book Note of Liuyanzhai also mentions this game, calling it shoushiling (t. 手勢令; s. 手势令), huozhitou (t. 豁指頭; s. 豁指头), or huaquan (划拳).
Mushi-ken, the earliest Japanese sansukumi-ken game (1809). From left to right: slug (namekuji), frog (kawazu) and snake (hebi).
Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to sansukumi-ken, meaning ken (fist) games where "the three who are afraid of one another" (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A).This type of game originated in China before being imported to Japan and subsequently also becoming popular among the Japanese.


## Strategies
It is impossible to gain an advantage over a truly random opponent. However, by exploiting the psychological weaknesses of inherently non-random opponents, it is possible to gain a significant advantage.Indeed, human players tend to be non-random.As a result, there have been programming competitions for algorithms that play rock paper scissors.During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament's commencement. Some tournament players employ tactics to confuse or trick the other player into making an illegal move, resulting in a loss. One such tactic is to shout the name of one move before throwing another, in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent.
The "rock" move, in particular, is notable in that it is typically represented by a closed fist—often identical to the fist made by players during the initial countdown. If a player is attempting to beat their opponent based on quickly reading their hand gesture as the players are making their moves, it is possible to determine if the opponent is about to throw "rock" based on their lack of hand movement, as both "scissors" and "paper" require the player to reposition their hand. This can likewise be used to deceive an anticipating opponent by keeping one's fist closed until the last possible moment, leading them to believe that you are about to throw "rock".
